                    Responsive Design means the development of flexible design that would respond to the changes in
                    the environment so that the design is incorporated accordingly. For example the changes in the 
                    size of screen or orientation like landscape. With responsive design these differences maintain
                    a good user experience. <br><br>
                    In website developement, user satisfaction, experience and usability is top priority and if its is
                     compromised then there is no point of designing a website so thoroughly. Web technologies incporporate 
                     the responsive design to accomodate resolution, width, height, overall size etc. For this purpose the 
                     website design should be flexible enough to switch according to the changes and fit the website to the screen size. 
                     Responsive design maintains the consistency of the web pages no matter how or where they are viewed. This can be achieved through 
                    the use of cascading style sheet media queries and grids based on percentage, relative units and fraction 
                    parts rather than fixed measurment units.<br><br>
                    I learnt that it is crucial to not only use strategies like media queries, flexible layouts, flexible grids, 
                     and flexible images while building web pages or apps for different devices but also test those out for devices
                      through developer tools, otherwise something can go wrong after the complete design which might result in bad 
                    user experience. The adjustment of the web pages should be smooth to fit every screen size. It is best that there
                     is no horizontal scrolling for any device size because it creates a bad user experience.<br><br>
                    In this course, I learnt a great deal about developing web pages starting from scratch. As a newbie, it was a fantastic experience
                     since the start of building my first web page till the final assessment website. All the assignments
                     and labs were really helpful. I was amazed at my own creation at the end and still there is so much
                    I can do to make my website look pretty and professional. I could not imgaine the potential and flexibility in designing web pages. 
                    This opens the doors of opportunities and creativity for me. This course has been designed perfectly as it covered the basics to 
                    advanced material while maintaining the perfect pace. But I still feel, the more I will keep practicing the more I will explore 
                    my own potential and the depths of web programming.
